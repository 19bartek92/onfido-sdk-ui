# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to the Node default version scheme, meaning It's safe to use with the caret ^ dependency definition.
The standard for the caret can [be found here](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#caret-ranges-123-025-004).
Breaking changes result in a different major. UI changes that might break customizations on top of the sdk, will be treated as breaking changes too.

## [0.6.0]
### Changed
- Public: `Onfido.init()` now returns an object.
- Internal: `isDesktop` detection is now based on [DetectRTC][detectrtc]'s `isMobile` detection
- Internal: improved Webcam Detection, it now takes into account wether a Webcam exists and if it the user has given the website permission to use it. Before it was only checking whether the **getUserMedia** API is supported by the browser or not. [DetectRTC][detectrtc] is used for this detection.
### Added
- Public: Possible to change options at runtime by calling `setOptions()` on Object returned by `Onfido.init()`
- Public: `useWebcam` options added to facial and document capture step
